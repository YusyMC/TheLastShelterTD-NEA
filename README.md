🧟 The Last Shelter TD

The Last Shelter TD is a tower defense game created as part of my A-Level Computer Science NEA coursework.
The game is still in development, with new features, levels, and gameplay mechanics being added progressively.

🎯 Project Overview

In The Last Shelter TD, players must defend a shelter against waves of zombies in a post-apocalyptic grassland.
The game features a top-down grid-based map, where players can strategically place towers to stop zombies from reaching the shelter.

This project demonstrates my skills in:

Python programming
Object-Oriented Design (OOP)
Game development using Pygame
User interface design
File handling and data persistence

🚧 Development Status
